Welcome to sleepy!
==================

This project contains a collection of tools designed to help with
data analysis in sleep research. Most of the tools are highly specific
to the data gathered in experiments by the Sleep Research Group
(http://www.helsinki.fi/science/helsleep/) of the University of Helsinki.

The current tools are:

  eeg/Superpower.xls
    Superpower reads EEG power sums generated by Ratpower and provides
    a simple mechanism for roughly scoring the data. Manual scores can
    also be imported. The scored power data is then analyzed and
    summarized for configured time bins.

    Superpower combines ideas from the earlier Powerhirmu 3.0, Helper 2.3
    and 3hdelta.xls tools, but the implementation is new.

  emg/emgscore.s2s
    Emgscore is a Spike2 script that helps in scoring EMG data.

  emg/EMGpower.xls
    EMGpower is a simplified version of Superpower, designed to work with
    the power output produced by emgscore.s2s.

These tools have been written by Kirsi-Marja Rytkönen and Jukka Zitting.
